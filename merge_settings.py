"""C Brain — wiring the hooks into ~/.claude/settings.json.

NON-DESTRUCTIVE, and that is the whole point: this file belongs to the user.
It may already hold their model, theme, permissions and their own hooks.
We ADD ours; we never rewrite the rest.

Idempotent: ownership is judged on the exact command. Re-running adds no
duplicate. Uninstalling removes ONLY our entries.

Usage:
  python3 merge_settings.py install [--settings <path>]
  python3 merge_settings.py remove  [--settings <path>]
