"""recall_feedback — closes the usage → ranking loop.

THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES. `inject_recall.py` appends to `state/recall_log.jsonl` and
**nobody ever reads that file back**. Same for `state/read_log.jsonl`, read only by the
3D visualisation. So for months the Brain had been logging what served and what never
served, and drawing nothing from it: 2.3% of suggested notes are actually opened, and
nothing corrected that rate.

WHAT IT COMPUTES. For each note, the number of times it was **suggested and then
actually opened within the same session**. That is the only honest signal available:
"suggested" alone proves nothing, "opened" alone can come from a manual search.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.
  • No penalty for notes that are never opened. A note can be excellent and badly
    described; punishing it in the ranking buries it for good and nobody ever sees it.

    ⚠️ AND ABOVE ALL: "often suggested, never opened" IS NOT a defect.
    Checked by hand over the 50 notes concerned — **exactly one** had a genuinely vague
    description. The others are the opposite case: their description ALREADY answers the
    question, so not opening the note is a SUCCESS.
    Example: `separation-pouvoirs-agent-teams`, suggested 73 times, never opened — its
    description says everything in one line.
    The output file used to be called `descriptions-to-rewrite.json`: that name presumed
    the defect and would have pushed someone to rewrite 50 notes, that is, to destroy
    what works. It now describes the OBSERVATION, not a verdict. It is a starting point
    for an investigation, to be read note by note.
  • No deletion. This file touches no note.

Outputs:
  state/recall-utility.json               {path: {sugg, hit}} — read by brain_recall
  state/often-suggested-never-opened.json  raw observation, NOT a verdict (see above)

Usage:
  recall_feedback.py           recompute both files
  recall_feedback.py --report  recompute and print a readable summary
