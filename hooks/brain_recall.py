"""brain_recall — relevance retrieval inside the trunk.

The FOUNDATION of semantic recall: instead of loading all of MEMORY.md on every
session, we retrieve the top-k RELEVANT notes for a query.

Default backend = lexical BM25 (pure Python, ZERO dependencies, ZERO API, instant).
Architecture enfichable : un backend `Embedding` (sentence-transformers local) pourra
replace or complement BM25 without touching the caller — that is the "true semantic" upgrade.

Usage :
  brain_recall.py "rotation main capteur profondeur"        → top-k fiches
  brain_recall.py -k 8 "billing AI costs"
  brain_recall.py --json "..."                              → sortie machine

# Light French stemming. Without it, "ranger" and "rangement" are two tokens that are
# strangers to each other: the query "comment ranger une fiche du brain" never touched
# jardinage-regles.md, whose description says "rangement". BM25 was not missing the note
# for lack of subtlety, it was missing it for lack of lexical overlap.
#
# Two stages, and the ORDER is the heart of the fix:
#   1. the PLURAL first, otherwise "fiche" and "fiches" never meet ("fiches" fell on the
#      -es rule and gave "fich", while "fiche" stayed "fiche") — it is the most frequent
#      word in the trunk, missing it ruins everything;
#   2. then A SINGLE suffix, longest to shortest, and only if the stem keeps at least
#      4 letters.
# Deliberately conservative: a greedy stemmer manufactures silent collisions that damage
# every other query. Ambiguous suffixes are therefore absent — -re turned "mesure" into
# "mesu", and -es/-ee duplicate stage 1.
