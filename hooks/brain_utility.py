"""brain_utility — the truth loop: measures the real USEFULNESS of each note.

Cross-references state/recall_log.jsonl (notes surfaced by recall) with
state/read_log.jsonl (notes actually read). Derives, per note:
  - surfaced  : how many times the retriever surfaced it
  - read      : nb de fois lue
  - hit       : surfaced AND read in the SAME session (recall actually paid off)
And sorts the notes into categories the gardener can act on:
  - 💀 dead weight : never surfaced, never read (an archiving candidate — A PROPOSAL)
  - 🔇 ignored     : surfaced ≥3× but never read (weak description? low value?)
  - ⭐ pillar      : read a lot (keep it, perhaps split it)

A signal grounded in USAGE, not introspection. Honestly: a note can be useful
without being *read* (the pointer in context was enough) → "ignored" is a hint, not a verdict.
