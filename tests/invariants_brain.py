Each test states a RELATION between two halves of the system that, read separately,
look right. Run: python3 tests/invariants_brain.py   (rc != 0 when an invariant breaks)

Born of a real audit: the challenger's sensor counted `len(coherence.json)`

agent). The result: a sonnet agent woken every 12 h for nothing, which
preempted the architect — and a check_coherence dying on a KeyError over the same entry.
