english_only.py — guards the ONE thing nothing else watches: the translation.

`main` is English, `fr` is the French source, and the step between them is a
human reading a diff. That step has already failed four times in the open:
`brain status` answering "(pas de statut)", `brain review` answering "aucune
paire en attente", `brain selftest` printing "hors-tronc", and the planet
labelling a panel "⚠ avis du challenger" — each of them on a screen a user
looks at, each shipped in a release.

WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. Only text a USER can see:
string literals and HTML content. Not comments — the README says plainly that
hook comments are still being translated, and a check that fails on a known,
declared state is a check people learn to ignore.

SOME FRENCH IS THE FEATURE. Several patterns match the USER's notes, not this
codebase: resume-point markers, the challenger's verdicts, the tokenizer's
letter class. Dropping their French would quietly stop serving anyone who
writes in French. Those lines opt out where they live — an `i18n-ok` on the
line, or the word BILINGUAL in the comment just above — so the reason travels
with the code instead of rotting in a list at the top of this file.

The signal is the French accent. It is nearly absent from English (café, résumé
— both listed as allowed below), and it is present in almost every French
sentence long enough to be a UI string. A word list would be endless and would
false-positive on "la", "on", "site"; accents are cheap and precise.
