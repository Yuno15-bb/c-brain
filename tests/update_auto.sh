# update_auto.sh — does the automatic update really do what it says?
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Since v1.28.0 session start no longer announces a new
# version: it INSTALLS it, in the background, without being asked. That is
# remote code running on somebody's machine. Three promises carry that decision,
# and an untested promise is only an intention:
#   1. it really APPLIES (otherwise we only removed the notice that worked);
#   2. it NEVER blocks the start of a session;
#   3. if the new version breaks the tool, it comes back on its own — because in
#      automatic mode nobody reads the screen.
#
# ⚠ THIS FILE IS PACKAGE-ONLY and lives in `tests/`, synced with
# `rsync --delete`: it MUST stay in the `sync_dir tests` exclusions. Written
# without the exclusion on 2026-08-16, it was wiped by the very next sync.
#
# Sibling of update_rollback.sh, same local fake upstream, same reason: a test
# that depends on the real GitHub fails for reasons unrelated to the code.
