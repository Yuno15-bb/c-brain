# update_rollback.sh — an update that cannot be undone is not an update.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `brain update` swaps out the engine, runs migrations and
# replays the installer, on a machine where the user keeps notes they cannot
# afford to lose. Everything about that is testable and none of it was tested:
# the CI proved the FIRST install works, never the second one, and never the
# way back.
#
# It runs against a LOCAL fake upstream, not GitHub. A test that depends on the
# real remote fails when a tag moves or the network hiccups, and a test that
# fails for reasons unrelated to the code is a test people learn to ignore.
#
# The two things it must prove, in order of how much they cost when wrong:
#   1. the user's notes survive an update AND a rollback — a memory tool that
#      loses memory during a version change has no reason to exist;
#   2. the engine actually moves, and actually comes back.
#
# Run: bash tests/update_rollback.sh          (macOS: install.sh targets Darwin)
