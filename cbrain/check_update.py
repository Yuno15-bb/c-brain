"""Automatic updates, wired to SessionStart.

The contract, in four points:
  · NEVER blocking — the update leaves DETACHED, in the background. A session
    must not wait on the network to start, and certainly not on a `git checkout`
    followed by a selftest.
  · Every session start. No 24 h window: that throttle made sense while the hook
    only PRINTED a line people eventually stopped reading. An update that
    applies itself has no reason to wait until tomorrow.
  · A DEFERRED report. What you see at session start is the result of the
    PREVIOUS pass: the current one has just left and has nothing to say yet.
    That is the price of being non-blocking, and it is an honest one — better
    news that is one session late than a session that waits.
  · It can be turned off. `brain update --auto-off`, or CBRAIN_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1:
    you then fall back to the old behaviour, report without applying.

ALWAYS exits 0: a hook never breaks a session.
